# Multi-level-marketing-MLM
Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a controversial marketing strategy in which the sales force is compensated not only for sales they generate, but also for the sales of the other salespeople that they recruit.

**N-Level Multi Level Marketing**

Code can be modifiable to N-Level. Currently Level has been set to 5. 

First make a initial user entry with sponser_id=0. To register new user 'NEW-USER' use 'Register.php' and sponser_id(if available). If sponser_id is provided then 5% of NEW-USER of purchase will be credited to each level above. If horizontal and vertical level(5 for now) is exceded then user specified sponser_id is ignored.

If any user cancels the purchase then reverse credit of commision will happen on belonging levels.
